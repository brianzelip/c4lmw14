Talking notes
=============
1.

Hi. My name is Brian Zelip. I'll be graduating this coming spring with an MLS in Library & Information Science from the University of Illinois. I'm a front-end web guy with a lot of experience working with youth, community institutions, and library patrons around digital literacies. 

I work in the University Library's Scholarly Commons, which is a specialized research services unit. I'm interested in data analysis & curation, and designing user interfaces that empower users.

I just got back from a trek around Iceland, which explains this background pic here. A cool sidenote is that sheep have no natural predators in Iceland. So farmers let them roam free for about 3/4 of the year, during which time you can see them walking along the side of the highway or hear them grazing outside of your tent at 2 in the morning.

Also, I'm organizing a node.js meetup in Urbana-Champaign with a fellow librarian coder. We aren't experts but are interested in learning. So consider this a vote for a breakout session on Node at this conference if any of you are working with it.

This morning I'm going to share a little bit of my recent experience talk briefly about

Migrating a library mobile app's website to an xml-based CMS

AND

Use cases at an academic research services unit
