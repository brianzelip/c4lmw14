Talking notes
=============

Hi. My name is Brian Zelip. I'll be graduating with an MLS in Library & Information Science from the University of Illinois in 2015. I'm a front-end web guy with a lot of experience working with youth and community institutions around digital literacies. 

I work in the University Library's Scholarly Commons, which is a specialized research services unit. I'm interested in data analysis & curation, and designing empowering user interfaces.

I just got back from a trek around Iceland, which is where this picture of sheep was taken. As a cool sidenote, sheep have no natural predators on Iceland, and farmers let their sheep graze freely for about 3/4 of the year, during which time you can see them walking along the side of the highway or hear them outside of your tent at 2 in the morning.

Also, I'm organizing a node.js meetup in Urbana-Champaign with a fellow LISer, not as experts but as folks interested in learning. So consider this a vote for a breakout session focused on Node during this conference if any of you are working with Node.
